# How to use
Sleek Favorites is a simple bookmark management chrome extension.  
Here's how to use:  
## Add a Favorite  
Hit the Add button and enter its URL and name, then hit the save button. Boom. Now it's ready.  
If you want to edit/delete your saved "favorites", then hit the edit button and click edit/delete button.  
*Caution! If you delete your favorites, it will be gone forever. If you want to add the same website, you have to add it again.  
## Notes  
You never know when a good idea pops up.  
That's why there's a note section.  
Simply hit the note button and the note section will appear on the right side.  
Jot down whatever comes to your mind.
